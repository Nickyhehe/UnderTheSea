                <h2>Blue Shark</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="desc">The blue shark (Prionace glauca) is a species of requiem shark. It has a slim, smooth-looking body with large eyes, and a long, cone-shaped snout. The dorsal surface is a dark blue colour, and the belly is white.The largest blue sharks can reach lengths of up to 3.8 metres, and weigh as much as 206 kg. The shark is found worldwide in temperate and tropical waters. They range from the surface to as deep as 350 metres, and prefer water with the temperature of 7 to 16 °C.
                <br>
                Blue sharks are found worldwide, in temperate and tropical waters. They are a pelagic species that rarely comes near shore. They have been known to frequently swim to inshore areas around oceanic islands, and locations where the continental shelf is narrow. In the western Atlantic they can be found from Newfoundland, Canada to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic they range from Norway to South Africa, including the Mediterranean. In the Indian Ocean, they range from South Africa to Indonesia. In the western Pacific they are found from Japan to New Zealand. In the eastern Pacific, Blue sharks range from the Gulf of Alaska to Chile.
                <br>
                The majority of the blue shark's diet consists of invertebrates such as squid, cuttlefish, and pelagic octopus, and bony fish such as herring and sardines.They also feed on various types of sea birds, crustaceans such as lobster, crab, and shrimp, and they also feed on carrion. - Wikipedia

                <h2>Great White Shark</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="desc">The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is a species of shark. It is the world's largest living predatory fish. Mature sharks may grow up to 6.4 m (21 ft) in length and 3,324 kg (7,328 lb) in weight. There also have been a few reports of great white sharks measuring over 8 m (26 ft). This shark reaches its sexual maturity around 15 years of age. The lifespan of a great white shark may be as long as 70 years or more. Great white sharks can accelerate to speeds over 56 km/h (35 mph).
                <br>

                Great white sharks have about 300 teeth, arranged in many rows. The first two rows of the teeth are used for grabbing and cutting the animals they eat, while the other teeth in the last rows replace the front teeth when they are broken, worn down, or when they fall out. The teeth have the shape of a triangle with jags on the edges. Great white sharks are carnivores. The great white sharks is an apex predator. It hunts fish, seals, sea lions, seagulls, penguins, squid, octopuses, dolphins, small whales, crabs, shrimps, stingrays, sea turtles and other sharks.
                <br>
                Great white sharks live in the sea. They live near the coast, in all warm waters. They occasionally make dives into the deep water of open oceans. They can be in water as shallow as three feet deep. The deepest scientists have seen a shark dive is about 1200 meters (4000 feet). That is down into the bathypelagic zone, where there is no sunlight. - Wikipedia

                <h2>Hammerhead Shark</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="desc">There are nine known species of Hammerhead sharks. They range from the length of 0.9 meters to the length of 6.1 meters, and weigh from 500 pounds to 1000 pounds. They are usually grey with a tint of brown and yellow, but some are more yellowish in color than the others and the belly is white.
                <br>
                The unusual structure of the head makes the head look like a hammer, this is why they are known as Hammerhead sharks. Since the eyes are positioned on the ends of the cephalofoil, Hammerheads are able to see everything around them, including what is under them, and what is above them. This head helps hammerhead sharks make very tight turns in the water, and it also helps them sense prey.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hammerhead sharks are aggressive hunters and feed on molluscs like octopuses and squids, and many types of fish. They also eat other types of sharks. the Hammerhead Shark's favourite type of food is rays. They are known to swim along the bottom of the ocean, following their prey. Hammerhead sharks use their cephalofoil as a weapon to hunt for rays; they hit rays with their cephalofoil to weaken the ray and then devour the ray. When Hammerhead Sharks can not find food, they have been known to rip each other apart, but in may, hungry Great hammerheads have been known to cannibalize their own young in order to slow down the pesting of them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hammerhead Sharks are viviparous, meaning they produce birth. Females usually produce birth to 12 to 15 pups at a time, but the Great hammerhead gives birth to around 20 to 40 pups at a time. Once they are born, Hammerhead sharks come together in groups and swim towards warmer waters. They stay together in groups until they are older and big enough to live on their own. Hammerhead sharks live for around 20 to 30 years. - Wikipedia

                <h2>Whale Shark</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="desc">The whale shark has a streamlined body and a wide, flattened head. The mouth is transverse, very large and is nearly at the tip of the snout. The gill slits are also very large, and are designed as filtering screens. The first dorsal fin is much larger than the second dorsal fin, and is located at the back of the body. The caudal fin is semi-lunate (crescent-shaped) in adults, and with the young, the upper lobe is quite longer than the lower lobe. The whale shark has a unique "checkerboard" colour pattern of light spots and stripes on a dark background.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whale sharks are grey, blue or brown above, with a surface pattern of creamy white spots between pale, vertical and horizontal stripes. The belly is white. The use of the strange pattern on the whale shark is unknown, although many bottom-dwelling Whale sharks use these markings as a camouflage against their backgrounds. They can be as long as 41 feet (12.3 metres) in length, and weigh as much as 47,000 pounds (21.5 tonnes). However, it is believed that there are some whale sharks which can reach lengths of up to 67 feet (20 metres). The smallest free-living individuals are around 55 cm (21.7 inches) long. Whale sharks reach maturity at lengths of around 8–9 metres. They are the largest species of fish, and the largest animal that isn't a cetacean (whale)

            With the basking shark and the megamouth shark, the whale shark is one of the three known species of filter feeding sharks. It feeds mainly on plankton and nekton, small crustaceans, schooling fish, and sometimes on small tuna and squids. Whale sharks may also sometimes feed on phytoplankton and macroalgae. Unlike most plankton-feeding vertebrates, the whale shark does not depend on slow forward motion to operate its filtration mechanism. - Wikipedia
